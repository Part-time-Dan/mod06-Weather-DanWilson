# mod06-Weather App-DanWilson

## Description
Module 06 challenge for bootcamp to create a dynamic weather app that searches by city and returns the current weather and a 5 day forecast.

Objectives:

- Use and call an API to generate the data shown on screen
- Weather dashboard should have a form input to enter city names
- Searching for each city should display current and future conditions and add city to search history
- Data shown should include city name, date, icon representing weather condition, tempurature, humidity, and windspeed
- Clicking in the search history should bring up that city's information again


## Issues

As of deployment, the search history buttons returning a new query is not functional. Working to add this feature.
